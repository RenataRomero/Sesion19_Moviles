# API Call Practice
In this class we learned how to call an API from an Async Task on Android.

Using the sample url: https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2

You can receive a JSON with id, first name, second name and a link to an image which is the avatar.

With the help of a recycler view we create a template that has the next components:
  -ImageView
  -2 TextViews

Then a Bean called User with the next attributes:
  -id (Integer)
  -firstName (String)
  -secondName (String)
  -avatar (String)
